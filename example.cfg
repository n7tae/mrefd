# This Reflector Callsign is exactly seven uppercase characters and must begin with "M17-".
# The final three characters must be made from characters from A to Z and 0 to 9,

# Modules defines which modules are to be enabled.

# EncryptionAllowed specifies which modules encrypted traffic will be allowed.
# It is not an error to specify a module that is not configured.

# The IPv4BindAddr is usually 0.0.0.0 (the "any" address).

# Mrefd will use curl and icanhazip.com to obtain both your IPv4 and IPv6 external
